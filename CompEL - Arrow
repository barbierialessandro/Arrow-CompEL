Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL) 

CompEL ARROW :dart: :bow_and_arrow:

Arrow is a fast script (ETA 2 minutes) for a graphical estimation of several parameters (listed below) in Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL)
MD simulations. 

The double membrane partitions into two compartments A and B is estimated from the .gro file of the duplicated system using split-group0 and 1.
 
bulk-offsetA = 0.00 
bulk-offsetB = 0.00
cyl0-r       = 0.0      ; Split cylinder 0 radius (nm)
cyl0-up      = 0.0      ; Split cylinder 0 upper extension (nm)
cyl0-down    = 0.0     ; Split cylinder 0 lower extension (nm) 
cyl1-r       = 0.0      ; same for other channel 
cyl1-up      = 0.0 
cyl1-down    = 0.0
