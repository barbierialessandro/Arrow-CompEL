# Arrow-CompEL
Computational Electrophysiology Script

CompEL **ARROW** :bow_and_arrow: :dart: 

Arrow is a fast script (ETA 2 minutes) for a better (graphical) estimation of several parameters (listed below) in Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL) MD simulations. The double membrane partitions into two compartments A and B is estimated from the .gro file of the duplicated system using split-group0 and split-group1.

For the script send an email to barbierialessandro@hotmail.it with object "CompEL-Arrow"

Please send back any feedback for improving it !

V1.0 March'22

**List of parameters**: 

- bulk-offsetA = 0.00 
- bulk-offsetB = 0.00
- cyl0-r       = 0.0      ; Split cylinder 0 radius (nm)
- cyl0-up      = 0.0      ; Split cylinder 0 upper extension (nm)
- cyl0-down    = 0.0     ; Split cylinder 0 lower extension (nm) 
- cyl1-r       = 0.0      ; same for other channel 
- cyl1-up      = 0.0 
- cyl1-down    = 0.0
