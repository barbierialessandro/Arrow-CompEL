# Arrow-CompEL
Computational Electrophysiology Script

 - (1) CompEL ARROW :dart: :bow_and_arrow: - 
 - Arrow is a fast script (ETA 2 minutes) for a graphical estimation of several parameters in Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL) MD simulations. 
 - The double membrane partitions into two compartments A and B is estimated from the .gro file of the duplicated system using split-group0 and 1.
